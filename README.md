# Sealedsecrets-Auto-Reencrypt

This document outlines a proposed feature to enhance the `kubeseal` command-line interface (CLI) with the capability to automatically re-encrypt all existing `SealedSecret` Kubernetes objects within a cluster. This functionality aims to simplify the process of rotating the Sealed Secrets controller's public key and ensuring that all secrets are encrypted using the latest certificateâ€”regardless of the Kubernetes distribution or environment.

The project introduces a CI/CD pipeline that connects **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, **EKS**, and **ArgoCD**. It automates the following:

- Fetching the latest public certificate from the Sealed Secrets controller
- Re-encrypting all sealed secrets
- Committing changes to GitHub
- Synchronizing updates to the cluster using ArgoCD

This feature will **streamline secret rotation**, strengthen security hygiene, and reduce the operational burden on DevOps teams.

## Goals

- Automate the re-encryption of all SealedSecrets using the latest public certificate
- Integrate the process into a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
- Store updated secrets in GitHub in a secure path (`sealedsecrets-reencrypted/`)
- Sync changes to the Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD
- Reduce human error and increase secret rotation reliability

## Project Layout
  - infrastructure/argocd/sealedsecrets-app.yaml: File for Argo CD, a tool to automatically deploy and manage your Sealed Secrets in your Kubernetes setup.
  - sealedsecrets-reencrypted/: Folder where the updated, re-encrypted secret files are stored after Jenkins processes them.
  - Jenkinsfile: The script that tells Jenkins exactly how to automatically fetch the new certificate and re-encrypt your secrets.
  - master.key: The secret key the Sealed Secrets system uses to unlock your original secrets.
  - new-cert.pem: The new public key used to lock up your secrets again during the re-encryption process in Jenkins.
  - private-key.pem: Possibly a key used for managing the main secret key (master.key) or other security tasks.
  - public-cert.pem: Similar to private-key.pem, likely involved in managing the security keys.
  - reencrypt.sh: A script you might run manually to help with the re-encryption, similar to what Jenkins does automatically.

    

## Dependencies
  - Kubernetes Cluster: To run the Sealed Secrets controller and deploy the re-encrypted secrets.
  - Sealed Secrets Controller: Installed in the Kubernetes cluster to manage SealedSecret resources.
  - kubeseal CLI: Used in the Jenkins pipeline (and potentially reencrypt.sh) to fetch the certificate and seal/re-encrypt secrets.
  - Argo CD: Managing the deployment of Sealed Secrets configurations.
  - Jenkins: Automation server to run the pipeline.
  - Git: For version control of your configurations and the Jenkinsfile.
  - AWS CLI and Credentials: For interacting with your AWS EKS cluster.

    

## Jenkins Setup
  ### Connect Jenkins with GitHub and Docker (Important: Since the repository is private, authentication is required):
   - Configure GitHub credentials in Jenkins to allow access to the private repository.
   - Set up Docker credentials in Jenkins to push images to Docker Hub.

  ### Create a Pipeline Job:
   - Set up a new Jenkins pipeline to manage the deployment process.

  ### Use the Provided Jenkinsfile:
   - Configure the pipeline using the Jenkinsfile script included in this repository.

     

## Jenkinsfile Pipeline
  This Jenkins pipeline performs the following steps:
  ### Triggers
  Automatically triggered via GitHub webhook push events using `githubPush()`.
  ### Environment Configuration
  - Jenkins credentials store:
      1. AWS Access Key ID & Secret Access Key
      2. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
      3. AWS Region & EKS Cluster name
      4. Optional: ArgoCD authentication token (for manual sync)
