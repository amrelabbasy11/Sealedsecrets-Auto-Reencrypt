# Sealedsecrets-Auto-Reencrypt

## Overview
This project automates the process of fetching the latest public key from the Sealed Secrets controller on an AWS EKS cluster and re-sealing all existing SealedSecret Kubernetes objects using the new public key. It integrates GitHub, Jenkins, ArgoCD, and EKS to ensure a secure, fully automated GitOps workflow.

## Project Layout
  - infrastructure/argocd/sealedsecrets-app.yaml: File for Argo CD, a tool to automatically deploy and manage your Sealed Secrets in your Kubernetes setup.
  - sealedsecrets-reencrypted/: Folder where the updated, re-encrypted secret files are stored after Jenkins processes them.
  - Jenkinsfile: The script that tells Jenkins exactly how to automatically fetch the new certificate and re-encrypt your secrets.
  - master.key: The secret key the Sealed Secrets system uses to unlock your original secrets.
  - new-cert.pem: The new public key used to lock up your secrets again during the re-encryption process in Jenkins.
  - private-key.pem: Possibly a key used for managing the main secret key (master.key) or other security tasks.
  - public-cert.pem: Similar to private-key.pem, likely involved in managing the security keys.
  - reencrypt.sh: A script you might run manually to help with the re-encryption, similar to what Jenkins does automatically
