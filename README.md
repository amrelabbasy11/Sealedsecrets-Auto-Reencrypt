# Sealedsecrets-Auto-Reencrypt
This repository was developed as part of the Instabug Infrastructure Internship 2025. It automates the re-encryption of all Kubernetes SealedSecrets using the latest public certificate after key rotation. The solution integrates Jenkins CI, ArgoCD, and GitOps workflows with email-based logging for secure and traceable operations.
